'''
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: 
“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T 
that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”


Example 1:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

class Solution(object):
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        if p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        elif p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        else:
            return root
